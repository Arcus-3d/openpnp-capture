OpenPnP Capture is a cross platform video capture library with a focus on machine vision. It's goals are:

* Native camera access on Windows, Linux and Mac. Implemented with MediaFoundation, V4L2 and AVFoundation respectively.
* Named device enumeration.
* Strong, repeatable unique IDs.
* Format control with support for at least YUV and MJPEG. MJPEG will allow the use of multiple USB cameras on a single hub.
* Auto and manual exposure control.
* Auto and manual focus control.
* Simple, common C wrapper for the listed APIs.

It's not finished yet. It's not even working yet.
